## Inkwell
This is a journal based web app. I used it to test my knowledge of database and manipulation. It allows users to create an account, create entries which are also saved to the database and accessible at a later time when required. I also learnt how to hash passwords before being saved.

I made use of HTML, CSS for styling, JavaScript for basic DOM Manipulation, Python(Flask) for backend and SQLAlchemy for database. It is a work in progress so the UI will be improved in days yo come. A link to the live project would be made available as soon as possible.
